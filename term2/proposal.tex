\chapter{Our Proposal}

Our ultimate goal is to build a comprehensive and universal framework for computer-aided drug discovery, incorporating capabilities of binding site identification, molecular docking, virtual screening, ligand synthesis, ADMET properties prediction, and so on, and utilize such framework to address practical drug discovery problems in real life. The development of idock is just the start. There is a long way to go to fully implement all the capabilities and apply them to case studies.

\section{istar: A SaaS Platform for idock}

Having developed and advertised idock, we kept receiving constant docking requirements from our colleges and collaborators. They are mostly biochemists and pharmacists, outsourcing the docking research to us after discovering potential biological targets for certain diseases of interest. All of a sudden, we had to grab the protein structure, do format conversion, define search space, set up docking parameters, and run idock for a long period of time. Sometimes we also had to restart virtual screening in case the idock process got killed by others or by exceptions. Tedious enough, all the above work was done manually, resulting in a very low research productivity.

We propose istar, a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform for idock. The goal of istar is to automate the virtual screening process. Without tedious software installation, users, especially computational chemists, can submit jobs on the fly in either of three ways: 1) browsing our web site, 2) programming against our RESTful API, or 3) sending emails conforming to our specifications.

Figure \ref{istar:Architecture} shows the architecture of istar. On the client side, we seamlessly combine both the Twitter Bootstrap and the HTML5 Boilerplate into a HTML5- and CSS3-powered web site. We use the Modernizr JavaScript library to detect HTML5 and CSS3 features in order to maintain compatibility in older browsers. We adopt the \textit{de facto} jQuery JavaScript library to simplify HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions. We test the user interface on Google Chrome 19, Mozilla Firefox 12, Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 and Apple Safari 5.

On the server side, we build the web server in event-driven node.js on top of the well known express server, forking multiple processes to accept simultaneous HTTP connections. We expose the functionalities of job submission and job query as RESTful API for others to program against. We also set up a gmail account and develop a mail crawler on top of Context.IO, a RESTful API for manipulating mailboxes, messages and attachments, to retrieve new jobs directly from emails. We employ the forever utility for both the web server and the mail crawler to ensure failover and high availability.

On the database side, we adopt MongoDB, a scalable, high-performance, open source NoSQL database. MongoDB features document store in JSON style, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring flexible document attributes like istar. MongoDB is written in C++, making it easy to manipualte database operations from idock, which is also written in C++. By using a 10gen-supported MongoDB driver for node.js, we are able to save jobs from both the web server and the mail crawler. In addition to holding jobs, the MongoDB database also maintains ligand chemical properties such as molecular weight and partition coefficient clogP. With indexes built on these properties, we are able to instantly reply to users the number of ligands shortlisted given any filtering conditions.

On the network file system side, we collect 12,171,291 clean ligands from the ZINC database \citep{532} in mol2 format. We convert them all into PDBQT format in batch for subsequent docking. The yuck-compound-free ligands are organized into a total of 128 slices, with each slice containing approximately 95,000 clean ligands. Among the 128 slices, 98 are at pH 7, 12 at pH 6-8, 9 at pH 8.5-9, and 9 at pH 4.5-6. The entire network file system is shared by all the backend workstations.

On the workstation side, we develop a customized version of idock 1.4, adding necessary code to iteratively fetch a pending job slice from MongoDB, reuse receptor and grid maps if possible, perform 2-phase virtual screening, report progress to MongoDB from time to time, and send email notification upon job completion. We exclusively reserve 4 workstations, equipped with Intel Core i5-2400 CPU @ 3.10GHz and 4GB DDR3 SDRAM and running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4 Build 11E53, to actually carry out jobs. Using a workstation, on average it takes a week to screen one single slice. Therefore, even though we thoroughly utilize all the 4 workstations, it can take up to 32 weeks, i.e. 7 months, to complete one single job. In order to boost job execution, we plan to port idock to GPU and deploy new workstations equipped with high-end GPU chips. A speed up of an order of magnitude is expected.

Figure \ref{istar:Website} shows istar web site. Job progress will be displayed in the upper section, while new jobs can be submitted in the lower section. A new job typically consists of several compulsory fields as well as several optional fields. Compulsory fields include a receptor in PDBQT format, a search space defined by a cubic box, a short job description, and an email to receive completion notification. Optional fields include 8 ligand filtering conditions, like molecular weight, partition coefficient clogP, number of hydrogen bond donors, number of hydrogen bond acceptors, number of rotatable bonds, polar surface area tPSA, apolar desolvation and polar desolvation. We set up default values for optional fields, and only the ZINC ligands satisfying all the 8 filtering conditions will be screened.

istar features slice-level parallelism. Generally speaking, workstations can compete for jobs or slices, with the former known as job-level parallelism and the latter as slice-level parallelism (Figure \ref{istar:2LevelParallelism}). Job-level parallelism is very straightforward to implement and can ensure 100\% utilization of computational power when the number of jobs exceeds the number of workstations. Nevertheless, when the number of workstations exceeds the number of jobs, which is usually the case in practice during the initial stage of istar, slice-level parallelism can better utilize computational power by subdividing a job into 128 slices which are then distributed to workstations. Slice-level parallelism is, in contrast, difficult to implement. The technical hurdle becomes even more apparent when progress must be reported to MongoDB from time to time, and progresses from multiple slices must be combined to compute an overall progress.

istar features 2-phase docking, due to as many as 12 millions ligands to screen. In phase 1, idock performs coarse but fast virtual screening without writing any conformations to file, aiming to quickly shortlist a few candidate compounds. In phase 2, idock performs fine and slow virtual screening, writing as many conformations to file as possible, aiming to refine the predicted free energy of candidate compounds. Such a 2-phase docking methodology can significantly reduce job execution time while avoiding the risk of filtering out promising compounds, resulting in a low false negative rate.

\end{figure}

istar serves as our foundation for SaaS. With istar at hand, basically we can expose any of our software as a service. Once we manage to host idock at istar, it will be quite easy for us to host our other tools, such as igrow for computational synthesis of potent ligands.

As for software availability, similar to idock, istar is also hosted at GitHub for version control and freely available at http://github.com/HongjianLi/istar. Its source code is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 while its documentation is licensed under CC BY 3.0. A live demo will be available at http://istar.cse.cuhk.edu.hk when we finish implementing istar.

\section{GPU Acceleration with CUDA/OpenCL}

Even though idock outperforms AutoDock Vina by 10x in terms of docking speed, it still required about 10 hours on average to dock 10,928 drug-like ligands against a certain protein, not to mention massive docking of millions of ligands. Virtual screening remains a time-consuming practice. Faster algorithms and implementations are highly desired.

GPU implementations of some other docking programs \citep{723,652,779}, and we also have expertise in GPU programming \citep{1138}.

We propose to develop both CUDA and OpenCL versions of idock, harvesting the trenemdous computational power offered by modern GPUs nowadays.

\section{Click Chemistry}

For computational synthesis of potent ligands, even though igrow implements Lipinski's \textit{Rule of Five}, it neglects selectivity, ADMET properties and other drug-like properties, possibly resulting in a high false positive rate. We plan to integrate igrow and ADMET prediction methods into idock to gain speedup and compose a uniform interface.

\section{ADMET Property Prediction}

It was estimated that 40\% to 60\% of new chemical entity (NCE) failures can be attributed to poor ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profiles.

PKKB (PharmacoKinetics Knowledge Base) \citep{1133} provides the most extensive collection of freely available data for ADMET properties up to date. PKKB integrates 31,412 experimental or predicted values for 1,685 drug and drug-like molecules from published literature with available experimental ADMET properties including partition coefficient (logP), solubility (logS), intestinal absorption, Caco-2 permeability, human bioavailability, plasma protein binding, volume of distribution, distribution of blood, half-time, excretion, urinary excretion, clearance, toxicity, etc. (Table \ref{PKKB:Properties})

Figure \ref{PKKB:Schema} shows the PKKB schema. Raw data from literature was first converted into proper formats and then integrated into a central ADMET database. A web site is provided for interactive search of ADMET properties given either structure or descriptive text of compounds of interest.

Thanks to the availability of reliable experimental data and basic structural information from PKKB enables, \textit{in silico} ADMET modeling becomes viable. One can predict ADMET properties from chemical structures for a huge number of compounds without actually synthesizing or assaying them.

We propose to make use of advanced machine learning techniques to train a prediction model (Figure \ref{PKKB:Schema}). Once the model is constructed, it is possible to predict ADMET properties of any given compounds. Coupled with conformations and free energy predicted by our tool idock, we can better evaluate a compound from a wide variety of perspectives, leading us to higher drug discovery success rate.
