We are collaborating with biochemists and pharmacists on several high-impact drug discovery projects.

\section{Influenza A Virus H1N1}

Influenza viruses has been causing sporadic pandemics and annual epidemics worldwide, resulting in about three to five million cases of severe illness and claiming 250,000 to 500,000 lives each year according to the fact sheets of World Health Organization. The H1N1 swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the ever-present threat of H5N1 acquiring human-to-human transmission capability remind us of the imminent danger posed by the influenza virus.

To date, four antiviral drugs have been approved by the FDA. They are oseltamivir (Tamiflu\textsuperscript{\textregistered}), zanamivir (Relenza\textsuperscript{\textregistered}), amantadine (Symmetrel\textsuperscript{\textregistered}) and rimantadine (Flumadine\textsuperscript{\textregistered}) \citep{1229}. Three of them (oseltamivir, amantidine, rimantidine) are now found to be ineffective against circulating strains due to the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viral mutations in pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses. Besides, amantadine and rimantadine exhibit side effects on the central nervous system. These alarming facts highlight the urgent need for designing new anti-influenza drugs.

Influenza viruses are negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. They are classified into types A, B and C based on the antigenic difference in their nucleoproteins and matrix proteins. Influenza A is the major pathogen for most cases of epidemic influenza. Influenza A viruses are further organized into 16 hemagglutinin subtypes (H1-H16) and 9 neuraminidase subtypes (N1-N9) according to their distinct antigenic properties. The influenza A genome code for 11 proteins, which are hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein 1 (M1), M2 proton channel, nucleoprotein (NP), non-structural protein 1 (NS1), nuclear export protein (NEP), polymerase acid protein (PA), polymerase basic proteins (PB1 and PB2) and PB1-F2.

Inhibitors of several viral proteins have been identified. Neu5Ac (N-acetylneuraminic acid) targets the sialic acid binding site of HA. TBHQ (tert-butylhydroquinone) targets the TBHQ binding site of HA. Oseltamivir and zanamivir target the active site of NA. Amantadine and rimantadine target the inside pore near Ser31 of M2. No inhibitors have been firmly established for the rest 8 viral proteins, but leads have been proposed in some cases.

The influenza viral nucleoprotein, identified as an antiviral target \citep{906}, forms the protein scaffold of the helical genomic ribonucleoprotein complexes, and interacts with the viral RNA polymerase to promote viral RNA replication. Oligomerization of the nucleoprotein is mediated by a flexible tail loop that is inserted into the body domain of a neighbouring nucleoprotein molecule and makes extensive interactions through intermolecular $\beta$-sheets, hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges \citep{1140} (Figure \ref{Case:2IQH}). A salt bridge between E339 lining the binding pocket and R416 on the tail loop is crucial for tail-loop binding \citep{1232,1233}. The amino acids in the tail-loop binding groove for nucleoprotein oligomerization are identical among several influenza A strains, and the displacement of the tail loop from its binding pocket causes significant structural rearrangements in nucleoprotein and completely abolishes the replication and transcription functions \citep{1231}. Chemical compounds which competitively displace the tail loop from its binding pocket would interfere with viral genome replication, and therefore serve as promising compounds for anti-influenza drug development \citep{1140}. The tail-loop peptide can inhibit nucleoprotein oligomerization and slow down viral replication. A potent inhibitor of nucleoprotein of wild-type and mutant strains has been identified through virtual screening \citep{1233}.

The influenza A RNA polymerase is a heterotrimer composed of three subunits, namely PA, PB1 and PB2. It binds the conserved 3' and 5' ends of each of the 8 single-stranded RNA segments in the influenza A virus genome. All the three subunits are required for both transcription and replication. PA is involved in assembly of the functional complex, cap binding and vRNA (virion RNA) promoter binding. PB1 carries the polymerase active site. PB2 includes the capped-RNA recognition domain. On one hand, the carboxy-terminal domain of PA forms a deep and highly hydrophobic groove (residues 257-716) into which the amino-terminal residues of PB1 (residues 1-16) can fit by forming a helix and interact through an array of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts \citep{1141} (Figure \ref{Case:2ZNL}). The loss of PA abolishes RNA polymerase activity and viral replication. PA and its interface with PB1 are therefore potential drug targets \citep{1141}. A peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 25 residues of PB1 inhibits the polymerase activity and viral replication, presumably by blocking the assembly of the polymerase trimer \citep{1234}. A novel inhibitor targeting the PA-PB1 binding site has been discovered by virtual screening \citep{1235}. On the other hand, PB2 binds the 5' cap of host pre-mRNAs, which are cleaved after 10-13 nucleotides by the endonucleolytic activity of PB1. Residues 318-483 of PB2 form the cap-binding domain (Figure \ref{Case:2VQZ}). An inhibitor of cap-snatching activities of PB2 has been identified by high-throughput screening \citep{1236}.

We collaborate with Prof. Pang-Chui Shaw and his team from Department of Biochemistry at Chinese University of Hong Kong, and employ structure-based virtual screening on nucleoprotein and polymerase subunits PA and PB2 in order to identify novel class of anti-influenza drugs (Figure \ref{Case:InfluenzaProjectFlow}). We obtained the X-ray crystal structures of influenza viral nucleoprotein with PDB ID 2IQH \citep{1140}, influenza A RNA polymerase subunits PA-PB1 complex with PDB ID 2ZNL \citep{1141}, and subunit PB2 in complex with m\textsuperscript{7}GTP with PDB ID 2VQZ \citep{1192}. For the nucleoprotein, we removed chains B and C and only retained chain A. For the PA-PB1 complex, we removed PB1 and only retained PA. For the PB2-m\textsuperscript{7}GTP complex, we removed PB2 chains B, D, E, F and m\textsuperscript{7}GTP and only retained PB2 chain A. Using idock 1.5 with a fine grid map granularity of 0.08\AA, we docked 7,220,835 ZINC \citep{532} clean ligands against nucleoprotein chain A and 73,648 ZINC clean ligands against PA. All the ligands are free of yuck compounds and have a molecular weight of at least 350g/mol. The docking took us 5 months. Later on we developed idock 1.6 and used it to dock 1,869,678 ligands against PB2 with vendor information available. Figures \ref{Case:2IQH-ZINC20464531} and \ref{Case:2IQH-ZINC33733935} depict the interactions between influenza viral nucleoprotein chain A and two high-rank ligands. Figures \ref{Case:2ZNL-ZINC17206951} and \ref{Case:2ZNL-ZINC40879809} depict the interactions between influenza A RNA polymerase subunit PA and two high-rank ligands. Figures \ref{Case:2VQZ-ZINC03015113} and \ref{Case:2VQZ-ZINC08386295} depict the interactions between influenza A RNA polymerase subunit PB2 and two high-rank ligands.

The top scoring compounds will be subjected to post-screening evaluations, including Lipinski’s rule filter, visual inspection and consensus docking using DOCK \citep{1222}, AutoDock Vina \citep{595}, or PLANTS \citep{610,607,779}. The commercially available compounds will be purchased for subsequent biological evaluations.

The cytotoxicity of the compounds will first be tested by MTT assay. Influenza RNP (ribonucleoprotein) reconstitution assay will then be performed to investigate their ability to inhibit RNP transcriptional activity. Hit compounds causing significant reduction of RNP activity will be subjected to whole virus assay including plaque reduction assay and yield reduction assay using seasonal flu viruses. Surface plasmon resonance will also be performed to test the \textit{in vitro} binding affinity of the compounds to the target protein. 

For compounds that exhibit substantial anti-influenza properties, chemical analogues will be purchased for further evaluation. Structure activity relationship study will be performed to further characterize the interaction between the compound and the target protein.

We believe such precious experience builds us strong confidence to subsequently work on other influenza A subtypes like H5N1 (bird flu).

\section{CCRK-Related Cancers}

CCRK (Cell Cycle-Related Kinase), also known as p42, CDK-related kinase PNQALRE, or CDK20, is a newly identified 42kDa protein containing all 11 conserved subdomains characteristic of serine/threonine protein kinase.

Prof. Marie Chia-Mi Lin and her team from Department of Surgery at Prince of Wales Hospital investigated the involvement of CCRK in glioblastoma multiforme carcinogenesis. They analyzed the expression levels of CCRK in 26 glioma patient samples and normal brain, and observed that 1) knock down of CCRK by siRNA (small-interfering RNA) inhibited glioblastoma cell proliferation, 2) suppression of CCRK by shRNA (short hairpin RNA) inhibited glioblastoma tumor growth in nude mice, and 3) CCRK overexpression conferred tumorigenicity to a non-tumorigenic U-138 cell line, and concluded CCRK to be a candidate oncogene in glioblastoma multiforme tumorigenesis \citep{1144}.

Moreover, they examined CCRK expression in a series of ovarian carcinoma tissues by immunohistochemistry, and detected overexpression of CCRK in 53\% of the ovarian carcinomas, and found it positively correlated with patients' clinicopathological characteristics \citep{1145}. They also investigated the role of CCRK in human colorectal cancer carcinogenesis, and found that CCRK protein levels were elevated by more than 1.5-fold in 70\% of colorectal cancer patient samples examined and CCRK was detectable in all seven colorectal cancer cell lines tested \citep{1143}. Suppression of CCRK by siCCRK led to G1 phase cell cycle arrest and reduced cell growth. CCRK is required for the phosphorylation of CDK2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2) on Thr160 and Rb on Ser795 and the expression of cyclin E \citep{1143}. 

Furthermore, together with Prof. Joseph Jao-Yiu Sung's team, they used genome-wide location and functional analyses to identify CCRK as a direct androgen receptor-regulated gene that drives $\beta$-catenin/T cell factor-dependent hepatocarcinogenesis \citep{1146}. Conversely, knock down of CCRK decreased hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth. CCRK overexpression correlated with the tumor staging and poor overall survival of patients \citep{1146}.

They therefore attempted to seek for CCRK inhibitors for the treatment of cancers and drug resistances. Due to the absence of CCRK structure in the PDB database \citep{540,537}, they utilized Chem3D from the then CambridgeSoft company, now acquired by PerkinElmer, Inc., to build a homologous model of CCRK from CDK2 based on the fact that they share 35\% sequence identity (Figure \ref{Case:CDKAlignment}), and performed protein-ligand docking of TCMs (Traditional Chinese Medicines) with AutoDock 3.0.5 and Cerius2 LigandFit, and identified 22-O-Angeloyl theasapogenol B (PubChem CID 5318850) as a potential potent inhibitor that could fit into the deep and narrow active site of their homologous model of CCRK. It was, nevertheless, very difficult to purify the compound from puerh tea.

\end{figure}

We are collaborating with Prof. Lin's team on identifying inhibitors of CCRK. We used as receptor the CCRK homologous model (Figure \ref{Case:CCRKHomologousModel}) built by Dr. William Cheung based on the CDK2 template with PDB ID 1HCL \citep{1142} using SWISS-MODEL, a fully automated protein structure homology-modeling server accessible via the ExPASy web server. We concentrated on repurposing approved drugs \citep{944,1023} because developing a drug \textit{de novo} is a laborious and costly endeavor. Using idock 1.5 with a fine grid map granularity of 0.08\AA\ and 512 Monte Carlo tasks, we screened 1,715 FDA-approved drugs via DrugBank and 3,176 FDA-approved drugs via DSSTOX. Figures \ref{Case:1HCL-ZINC03830332} and \ref{Case:1HCL-ZINC03831625} depict the interactions between the CCRK homologous model and two high-rank ligands.

\section{Cancer Stem Cells}

Prof. Hsiang-Fu Kung and Dr. Hong Yao from Stanley Ho Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases at Chinese University of Hong Kong are seeking specific therapies targeted at CSCs (Cancer Stem Cells) for improvement of survival and quality of life of cancer patients.

CSCs are cancer cells that possess the ability to give rise to all cell types found in a particular cancer sample. As the highly malignant seeds of tumors, CSCs typically comprise 1-5\% of the tumor but give rise to 95-99\% of other tumor cells known as the tumor bulk, and are therefore tumorigenic. While standard therapies, including chemotherapy and radiation, may initially shrink tumors by killing tumor bulk, the failure of these therapies to eradicate CSCs may attribute to treatment failure, tumor relapse and poor survival (Figure \ref{Case:CancerStemCell}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Case/CancerStemCell.eps}
\caption{CSCs-specific and conventional cancer therapies. Cells in blue are normal cancer cells. Cells in yellow are CSCs. Source: Wikipedia.}
\label{Case:CancerStemCell}
\end{figure}

Salinomycin (Figure \ref{Case:SalinomycinEtoposideAbamectinNigericin}, reprinted from \citep{1147}), a monocarboxylic polyether antibiotic widely used as an anticoccidiosis agent in chicken, was discovered in a chemical screen to selectively kills breast CSCs and reduce the proportion of CSCs by >100-fold relative to paclitaxel, a commonly used breast cancer chemotherapeutic drug. Treatment of mice with salinomycin inhibits mammary tumor growth \textit{in vivo} and induces increased epithelial differentiation of tumor cells \citep{1147}. At the molecular mechanism level, salinomycin specifically inhibits the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling pathway initiated by Wnt1 and selectively induces apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells \citep{1148}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Case/SalinomycinEtoposideAbamectinNigericin.png}
\caption{Chemical structures of salinomycin, etoposide, abamectin, and nigericin, compounds that exhibit selective toxicity for mesenchymally transdifferentiated epithelial cells. Figure reprinted from \citep{1147}.}
\label{Case:SalinomycinEtoposideAbamectinNigericin}
\end{figure}

We are collaborating with Prof. Kung's team on identifying inhibitors of CSCs. We confirm the Wnt protein as a potential pharmaceutical target of therapeutic interest. The major obstacle right now is the lack of resolved or homologous structures of Wnt. We can neither find a Wnt structure from the PDB database \citep{540,537}, nor predict its structure from known templates (Figure \ref{Case:WntHomologyModeling}). Although the 1JLT template shares 42\% sequence identity with Wnt, it only covers a small range of amino acids from 319 to 360. Ironically, the 1GTE template covers amino acids 13 to 354, but the sequence identity is as low as 14\%, far from sufficient for an accurate homologous model. In reality, we tried five online homology modeling servers, namely ModWeb, M4T, SWISS-MODEL, I-TASSER, and HHpred, but most of them simply refused our job just because of the surprisingly low sequence identity percentage. Therefore, rather than Wnt, one possible way to go is to explore other CSCs-associated signaling pathways such as Bmi-1, Shh, Notch, \textit{Hox} family, Pten, etc.
