We were motivated by the desire to automate large-scale protein-ligand docking using our idock and thus have developed istar, a general SaaS (Software as a Service) platform. Without tedious software installation, users, especially computational chemists, can submit jobs on the fly either by browsing our web site or by programming against our RESTful API. Our HTML5- and CSS3-powered web site supports 1) selecting ligands with desired molecular properties and previewing the number of ligands to dock, 2) monitoring job progress in real time, and 3) outputing supplier information, three very useful features commonly lacked on other online docking platforms like DOCK Blaster or iScreen. We have collected 12,171,187 yuck-free ligands from the clearn subset of ZINC with conditional permission from its developer. We have developed idock 1.6 for istar, further improving docking speed and accuracy, inventing new functionalities, and fixing bugs. To better evaluate and compare idock 1.6 with the state-of-the-art AutoDock Vina 1.1.2, we have carried out a redocking benchmark on the 2,455 protein-ligand complexes of the refined set of PDBbind v2011 and 343 protein-ligand complexes of CSAR NRC HiQ Set 24Sept2010, and a virtual screening benchmark on 12 diverse receptors and 3000 ligands of different molecular weight. The results have shown that under various circumstances idock displayed comparable success rates but outperformed AutoDock Vina in terms of docking speed by at least 8.69 times and at most 37.51 times, rendering idock particularly suitable for large-scale protein-ligand docking. We have developed an istar-customized daemon from idock 1.6, implementing two-phase docking and exploiting fine-grained slice-level parallelism in order to further shorten job execution time, as well as using gzip to compresses result files in order to save server storage and network bandwidth. We have tested the istar web site with Chrome 19+, Firefox 12+, IE 9+, Safari 5+ and Opera 12+. We have also prepared two graphical tutorials for newbies to get started easily. We plan to utilize GPU acceleration in a future release of idock and deploy GPU clusters for further speed up, aiming to make istar a really pragmatic large-scale online docking platform for the computational chemistry community and pharmaceutical companies.

\section*{\sffamily \Large SUMMARY}

We have developed istar, a general SaaS (Software as a Service) platform for online large-scale protein-ligand docking. Without tedious software installation, users can submit jobs on the fly either by browsing our web site or by programming against our RESTful API. Our HTML5- and CSS3-powered web site supports 1) selecting ligands with desired molecular properties and previewing the number of ligands to dock, 2) monitoring job progress in real time, and 3) outputing supplier information, three very useful features commonly lacked on other online docking platforms like DOCK Blaster \citep{557} or iScreen \citep{899}. We have collected 12,171,187 yuck-free ligands from the clearn subset of ZINC \citep{1178} with conditional permission from its developer. We have developed idock 1.6 for istar, further improving docking speed and accuracy, inventing new functionalities, and fixing bugs. We have developed an istar-customized daemon from idock 1.6, implementing two-phase docking and exploiting fine-grained slice-level parallelism in order to further shorten job execution time, as well as using gzip to compresses result files in order to save server storage and network bandwidth. We have tested the istar web site with Chrome 19+, Firefox 12+, IE 9+, Safari 5+ and Opera 12+. We have also prepared two graphical tutorials for newbies to get started easily.

\section*{\sffamily \Large INTRODUCTION} % Not needed for rapid communications

Protein-ligand docking predicts the preferred conformation and binding affinity of a small ligand when it is non-covalently bound to a specific binding site of a macro protein. Inspired by AutoDock Vina \citep{595}, we have developed idock 1.0 \citep{1153}, a multithreaded virtual screening tool for flexible ligand docking. idock inherits from AutoDock Vina the accurate scoring function and the efficient optimization algorithm, and meanwhile introduces a list of fruitful innovations, such as receptor and grid map caching for large-scale virtual screening, revised numerical model for much faster approximation, capability of automatic detection and deactivation of inactive torsions, utilization of our novel thread pool to parallelize grid map creation and reuse threads, utilization of modern C++11 features like right-value references to avoid frequent memory reallocation, and accelerated parsers for both receptor and ligand. When benchmarked on docking 10,928 drug-like ligands against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, idock 1.0 achieved a speedup of 3.3 in terms of CPU time and a speedup of 7.5 in terms of elapsed time on average compared to AutoDock Vina.

Despite the amazing speedup, idock 1.0 required about 10 hours to dock 10,928 drug-like ligands, not to mention massive docking of millions of ligands. Faster implementations are highly desired. Therefore we have developed idock 1.6, further improving docking speed and accuracy, inventing new functionalities, and fixing bugs. Refer to the idock web site for a full list of enhancements and bugfixes.

Having released idock, we kept receiving docking requirements from our colleagues and collaborators. They are mostly biochemists and pharmacists, outsourcing the docking research to us after discovering potential biological targets for certain diseases of therapeutic interest. All of a sudden, we had to grab the protein structure, do format conversion, define search space, set up docking parameters, and keep running idock in batch for months. Tedious enough, all the above work was done manually, resulting in very low research productivity. In order to boost efficiency and automate large-scale protein-ligand docking using our idock, we therefore developed istar, a general SaaS platform.

\section*{\sffamily \Large METHODOLOGY}

Figure \ref{istar:architecture} shows the architecture of istar. There are five major components: a web site, a web server, a database management system, several workstations, and a network file system. Under typical circumstance, a user browses our web site and submits a job. The web server first validates user input and then saves it into database. Several workstations run daemons in the background, fetching jobs from the database and carrying out experiments. Upon completion, they send a notification email to the user and write the result to the network file system, which is served and cached as static content. The user again browses our web site to download result.

\end{figure}

On the client side, we seamlessly combined both the Twitter Bootstrap and the HTML5 Boilerplate into a HTML5- and CSS3-powered web site, which was successfully checked as HTML5 by the W3C Markup Validator v1.3. We adopted the jQuery library to simplify HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions, and the jQuery UI library to provide themeable widgets. We tested our web site with Chrome 19+, Firefox 12+, Internet Explorer 9+, Safari 5+ and Opera 12+.

On the server side, we built the web server using the well-known asynchronous event-driven node.js on top of the express server, forking multiple worker processes to accept simultaneous HTTP/SPDY connections. We utilized the spdy node module to support SPDY protocol v3, the prototype of next generation HTTP 2.0, achieving reduced latency through compression, multiplexing, and prioritization. We employed the forever node module to restart worker processes automatically in case of unhandled exceptions, ensuring high availability. We made heavy use of regular expressions and developed a customized validator to validate and sanitize user input, ensuring data validity.

On the database side, we chose MongoDB, a scalable, high-performance, open source NoSQL database. MongoDB features document store in JSON style, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring flexible document attributes like our istar.

On the workstation side, we deployed a Linux workstation and four Mac workstations. The Linux workstation is equipped with Intel Xeon W3520 @ 2.66 GHz, 8GB DDR3 SDRAM and GeForce GTX 285 (1024 MB), and running Fedora 17 x64. The four Mac workstations are equipped with Intel Core i5-2400 @ 3.10GHz and 4GB DDR3 SDRAM, and running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4.

On the network file system side, we mounted a 2TB hard disk for shared use. All the five workstations can simultaneously access to the hard disk and perform file reading and writing. In principle, we will persist existing jobs and results until storage shortage.

\section*{\sffamily \Large DISCUSSION}

DOCK Blaster \citep{557}, an expert system, was created to investigate the feasibility of full automation of large-scale protein-ligand docking. Here we highlight the advantages of istar over DOCK Blaster. First and foremost, istar is free and open source under Apache License 2.0. Everyone is welcome to download a copy and deploy istar to his/her own servers. istar is designed as a general SaaS platform. It can host not only idock but also igrep and any other program. istar utilizes HTML5, CSS3, node.js, SPDY, NoSQL, GPU acceleration and so on, representing a state-of-the-art platform. istar supports filtering and previewing ligands to dock, as well as monitoring job progress in real time, two very useful features only available at istar. istar implements 2-phase docking and exploits fine-grained slice-level parallelism in phase 1.

Due to limited budget, we could not offer hardware resource as much as DOCK Blaster did (i.e. 700 CPU cores plus 20TB RAID-6 storage), so we tried every endeavor on software optimization. Alternatively, one can freely deploy a copy of istar. In the future we plan to port idock to GPU in order to further boost performance.
