\section*{Abstract}
We are motivated by the desire to automate large-scale protein-ligand docking for drug discovery using our docking engine idock and thus have developed a web platform called istar. Without tedious software installation, users can submit jobs on the fly either by using our web site or by programming against our RESTful API. Our HTML5-powered istar web site supports 1) filtering ligands by desired molecular properties and previewing the number of ligands to dock, 2) monitoring job progress in real time, and 3) outputting predicted free energy, ligand efficiency, RF-Score, putative hydrogen bonds, and supplier information for easy purchasing, three useful features commonly lacked on other online docking platforms like DOCK Blaster or iScreen. We have collected 12,171,187 ligands from the clean subset of the ZINC database with conditional permission from its developer. We have revamped our docking engine idock to version 2.1, further improving docking speed and accuracy, inventing new functionalities, and fixing bugs. We have prepared two graphical tutorials for novices to get started easily. We have tested our istar web site successfully in Chrome 19+, Firefox 12+, IE 9+, Safari 5+ and Opera 12+.

\section*{Introduction}
Protein-ligand docking predicts the preferred conformation and binding affinity of a small ligand when it is non-covalently bound to a specific binding site of a protein. Up to date, there are hundreds of docking programs \cite{493,922}. The AutoDock series is the most cited docking software in the research community. AutoDock has contributed to the discovery of several drugs, including the first clinically approved HIV integrase inhibitor \cite{1169}. Following its initial release, several parallel implementations were developed, using either multithreading or computer cluster \cite{115,560,782}.

In 2009, AutoDock Vina \cite{595} was released. As the successor of AutoDock 4 \cite{596}, AutoDock Vina significantly improves the average accuracy of the binding mode predictions while running two orders of magnitude faster with multithreading \cite{595}. It was compared to AutoDock 4 on selecting active compounds against HIV protease, and was recommended for docking large molecules \cite{556}. Its functionality of semi-flexible protein docking by enabling flexibility of side-chain residues was evaluated on VEGFR-2 \cite{1084}. To further facilitate the usage of AutoDock Vina, auxiliary tools were subsequently developed, including a PyMOL plugin for program settings and visualization \cite{609}, a bootable operating system for computer clusters \cite{773}, and a GUI for virtual screening on Windows \cite{1250}. AutoDock Vina is free and open source. So far it has been cited by over 500 publications according to Google Scholar, making it a very competitive docking program.

In 2011, inspired by AutoDock Vina, we developed idock 1.0 \cite{1153}, a multithreaded virtual screening tool for flexible ligand docking. idock inherits from AutoDock Vina the accurate scoring function and the efficient optimization algorithm, and meanwhile introduces plenty of innovations, such as receptor and grid map caching for efficient large-scale virtual screening, revised numerical model for much faster energy approximation, capability of automatic detection and deactivation of inactive torsions for dimensionality reduction, utilization of our lightweight thread pool to parallelize grid map creation and reuse threads, utilization of the new C++11 feature of right-value references to avoid frequent memory reallocation, and accelerated parsers for both receptors and ligands. When benchmarked on docking 10,928 drug-like ligands against HIV reverse transcriptase, idock 1.0 achieved a speedup of 3.3 in terms of CPU time and a speedup of 7.5 in terms of elapsed time on average compared to AutoDock Vina.

Having released idock, we kept receiving docking requirements from our colleagues and collaborators. They are mostly biochemists and pharmacologists, outsourcing the docking research to us after discovering pharmaceutical protein targets for certain diseases of therapeutic interest. Consequently, we had to grab the protein structure, do format conversion, define search space, set up docking parameters, and keep running idock in batch for months. Tedious enough, all the above work was done manually, resulting in very low research productivity. In order to automate large-scale protein-ligand docking using our idock, we have therefore developed a web platform called istar. istar is a web platform while idock is a concrete application hosted on the istar platform.

There are other online protein-ligand docking platforms. DOCK Blaster \cite{557} investigates the feasibility of full automation of protein-ligand docking. It utilizes DOCK \cite{1222} as the docking engine and ZINC \cite{532,1178} as the ligand database. iScreen \cite{899} is a compacted web server for TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) docking and followed by customized \textit{de novo} drug design. It utilizes PLANTS \cite{610,607,779} as the docking engine and TCM@Taiwan \cite{528} as the ligand database. It also utilizes LEA3D \cite{1223} for \textit{de novo} ligand design. FORECASTER \cite{1012} is a web interface consisting of a set of tools for the virtual screening of small molecules binding to biomacromolecules (proteins, receptors, and nucleic acids). It utilizes the flexible-target docking program FITTED \cite{602} as docking engine. Nevertheless, the above platforms neither provide ligand selection based on molecular properties, nor display job progress in real time. They also lack straightforward output of compound suppliers, a hurdle preventing users from purchasing high-rank compounds for further wet-lab verification. Our istar platform has properly addressed the above obstacles.

\section*{Features}

\subsection*{Ligand Filtering}
istar supports filtering ligands by desired molecular properties and previewing the number of ligands to dock. This feature is achieved by inter-process message passing and in-memory table scan.

Before docking a ligand, our idock daemon checks its 9 molecular properties against the 9 filtering conditions. If any condition fails, the daemon simply skips the current ligand and proceeds to the next one by looking up the offset table.

\subsection*{Real-Time Progress}
istar supports monitoring job progress in real time. This feature is achieved by the progress reporting mechanism inside our idock daemon as well as our Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) timer and table on the web site.

% Results and Discussion can be combined.
\section*{Results}
Compared idock to Vina
Compared idock to DOCK

idock x86\_64 v2.0 and AutoDock Vina x86 v1.1.2 were evaluated and compared on desktop computers with Intel Core i5-2400 CPU @ 3.10GHz and 4GB DDR3 RAM under Mac OS X 10.7.4 Build 11E53. Arguments to both programs were left as default. By default, both programs output 9 predicted conformations per ligand. The benchmarks include comparison of their redocking performance in terms of predicted conformations and binding affinity correlation, and comparison of their virtual screening performance in terms of execution time.

\subsection*{Benchmark of Redocking}
Redocking refers to randomizing the crystal ligand conformation in a protein-ligand complex and trying to dock the randomized conformation back to its crystal conformation as close as possible. For the redocking benchmark, we used three datasets, the refined set of PDBbind v2012 \cite{529,530}, the refined set of PDBbind v2011 \cite{529,530}, and the two sets of CSAR NRC HiQ Set 24Sept2010 \cite{857,960}. They comprise 2,897, 2,455 and 343 protein-ligand complexes respectively, with experimentally determined binding affinity data (Kd or Ki). Note that the 2rio entry of PDBbind contains two Sr (strontium) metal ions, which are supported by idock but not by AutoDock Vina, so we manually removed them before invoking AutoDock Vina.

Figure \ref{Redocking} visualizes the redocking results of four cases from the refined set of PDBbind v2011. In the case of PDB ID 1B8N, both programs managed to predict a conformation close enough to the crystal one. In the case of PDB ID 4TMN, both programs failed, probably due to the presence of a zinc ion in the binding site. In the case of PDB ID 1PKX, idock succeeded but AutoDock Vina failed. In the case of PDB ID 3HV8, AutoDock Vina succeeded but idock failed.

Color scheme of the 4 redocking figures.

Table \ref{SuccessRate} shows the success rates of idock and AutoDock Vina under various conditions regarding the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) values between the crystal and docked conformations. Given a redocking case, RMSD1 refers to the RMSD value between the crystal conformation and the first docked conformation, i.e. the one with the highest predicted binding affinity, while RMSDm refers to the RMSD value between the crystal conformation and the closest docked conformation, i.e. the one with the minimum RMSD value. The condition RMSD1 = RMSDm tests for how many percent the docked conformation with the highest predicted binding affinity actually turns out to be the closest one among the 9 predicted conformations. It can be seen that the success rates of idock are comparable to, albeit slightly lower than, AutoDock Vina, and the success rates on CSAR NRC HiQ Set 24Sept2010 are consistently higher than PDBbind v2011 and v2012, probably because the scoring function performs well on carefully refined structures. Using a RMSD value of 2.0 \AA, a publicly accepted positive control for correct bound structure prediction, both programs managed to predict a conformation close enough to the crystal conformation as the first conformation for over half of the cases on both databases.

Figure \ref{FECorrelation} shows the binding affinity correlation of idock and AutoDock Vina. On the CSAR NRC HiQ Set 24Sept2010 dataset, the Pearson correlations between experimental binding affinities and binding affinities predicted by AutoDock Vina, between experimental binding affinities and binding affinities predicted by idock, and between binding affinities predicted by AutoDock Vina and idock are 0.5998758, 0.5774972, and 0.9824049, respectively. Although both programs did well in conformation prediction, they could not predict binding affinity too accurately, a very common obstacle in the entire computational chemistry community. As expected, the correlation between binding affinities predicted by both programs is very close to 1 because of their identical scoring function but slightly different approximation methods.

\subsection*{Benchmark of Virtual Screening}
We collected 12 diverse proteins from the PDB (Protein Data Bank) database \cite{540,537}, and 1000 ligands with a molecular weight of 200-300g/mol2, 1000 ligands with a molecular weight of 300-400g/mol2, and 1000 ligands with a molecular weight of 400-500g/mol2 from the clean subset of the ZINC database \cite{532,1178}. The 3000 ligands (Figure \ref{MWT-NRB}) were docked against the 12 proteins by AutoDock Vina and idock. Since AutoDock Vina can dock only one ligand in a run, a bash script containing 1000 lines was executed instead, with each line being an execution of Vina to dock one individual ligand. The GNU Time utility was used as a profiler.

Table \ref{ExecutionTime} compares the CPU time and elapsed time of both programs. The execution time varies a lot from protein to protein and from molecular weight set to molecular weight set. Basically idock outperforms AutoDock Vina by at least 8.69 times and at most 37.51 times.

\section*{Discussion}

idock locally, why istar
12 million Ready-to-use ligands collected from ZINC, with supplier output plus RF-Score. Docking process has been automated
No set up required. No need to divide jobs into 100 slices. No need to write a script to filter ligands.

DOCK Blaster \cite{557}, an expert system, was created to investigate the feasibility of full automation of large-scale protein-ligand docking. Here we highlight the advantages of istar over DOCK Blaster. First and foremost, istar is free and open source under Apache License 2.0. Everyone is welcome to download a copy and deploy istar to his/her own servers. istar is designed as a general SaaS platform. It can host not only idock but also igrep and any other program. istar utilizes HTML5, CSS3, node.js, SPDY, NoSQL, GPU acceleration and so on, representing a state-of-the-art platform. istar supports filtering and previewing ligands to dock, as well as monitoring job progress in real time, two very useful features only available at istar. istar implements 2-phase docking and exploits fine-grained slice-level parallelism in phase 1.

Two virtual machines, Intel Xeon E5620 @ 2.40 GHz and 8GB DDR3 SDRAM.
A separate web server Intel Xeon W3520 @ 2.66 GHz and 8GB DDR3 SDRAM
Due to limited budget, we could not offer hardware resource as much as DOCK Blaster did (i.e. 700 CPU cores plus 20TB RAID-6 storage), so we tried every endeavor on software optimization. Alternatively, one can freely deploy a copy of istar. In the future we plan to port idock to GPU in order to further boost performance.

Give the structure of a target, both istar and DOCK Blaster will dock and score each molecule against the target and provide a ranked list which you may review and prioritize for purchase and testing.

\section*{Materials and Methods}
Figure \ref{architecture} shows the architecture of istar. There are five major components, a web site, a web server, a database management system, several workstations, and a network file system. Under typical circumstances, a user browses our web site and submits a job. The web server first validates user input and then saves it into the database. Several workstations keep running daemons in the background, fetching jobs from the database and docking ligands. Upon completion, they send a notification email to the user and write the result to the network file system, which is cached as static content by the web server. The user again browses our web site to download result or monitor job progress.

\subsection*{Web Site}
W3C (Worldwide Web Consortium) finalized the definition of HTML5 in December 2012. This means developers have a stable target to write applications for. Compared with HTML4, HTML5 provides a way to write rich web applications.

We have seamlessly combined both the Twitter Bootstrap and the HTML5 Boilerplate into a HTML5- and CSS3-powered istar web site (Figure \ref{idock}). From top to bottom, the first section displays information about existing jobs, including the number of ligands to dock, submission date, current status and progress, and result for download upon completion; the second section allows new job submission by specifying a receptor, its search space, and optionally, desired ligands to dock; the third section plots the histogram distributions of 9 molecular properties of the 12 million ligands; the fourth section delivers two graphical tutorials for newbies to get started easily. We have tested the web site successfully in Chrome 19+, Firefox 12+, Internet Explorer 9+, Safari 5+ and Opera 12+.

A job typically comprises compulsory fields and optional fields. Compulsory fields include a receptor in PDBQT format, a search space defined by a cubic box, a short job description, and an email to receive completion notification. Optional fields include 9 ligand filtering conditions, which are molecular weight, partition coefficient xlogP, apolar desolvation, polar desolvation, number of hydrogen bond donors, number of hydrogen bond acceptors, topological polar surface area tPSA, net charge, and number of rotatable bonds (Figure \ref{LigandProperties}), in the form of closed intervals. We set up the default values of lower and upper bounds for the 9 molecular properties. Only the ligands satisfying all the 9 filtering conditions will be docked. In order to nullify a specific filtering condition, one may expand its closed interval to cover the entire possible range because of the relationship of logical and.

We have prepared two graphical tutorials for users to correctly fill in the compulsory fields. Tutorial 1 illustrates how to prepare a receptor in PDBQT format with MGLTools \cite{596}. Tutorial 2 illustrates how to define a search space with MGLTools \cite{596}, Chimera \cite{1219} or PyMOL \cite{1221}. We deliberately do not introduce an automatic protein binding site detection tool but let the graphical tutorials guide this process with full customization.

\subsection*{Web Server}
We have built the web server using the high-performance express.js web application framework on top of the asynchronous event-driven node.js engine. In addition to the conventional HTTP 1.x protocol, the web server also supports the SPDY protocol v3, the prototype of next generation HTTP 2.0, achieving reduced latency through compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.

We have developed a customized validator module to validate and sanitize user input upon new job submission. Users will be notified by tips should there be any validation errors, such as invalid receptor format, excessively small or excessively large search space, or invalid email address. Only valid jobs are saved into the database.

\subsection*{database}
We have established the database using MongoDB, a scalable, high-performance, open source NoSQL database. MongoDB features document store in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) style, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring flexible document attributes like our istar. 

\subsection*{Workstations and Daemons}
We have deployed several workstations to simultaneously run a customized idock daemon in the background. We have derived the daemon from idock 2.0, adding dozens of lines of code to iteratively and atomically fetch a pending job from MongoDB, reuse the receptor structure and grid maps whenever possible, perform 2-phase docking, exploit 2-level parallelism, report progress to MongoDB, output verbose information, and send email notification upon job completion. We have further improved idock to version 2.0 in terms of docking speed and accuracy, new functionalities, and bugfixes.

\subsection*{Network File System}
We have configured a network file system for shared access from the workstations, the web server, and the database server. Onto the network file system, we have collected and saved 12,171,187 clean ligands at pH 7 in mol2 format from the ZINC database \cite{532,1178} with explicit permission of its major developer and maintainer, Prof. John J. Irwin at University of California, San Francisco. Originally the ligands are organized into 98 slices, with each slice containing approximately 125,000 clean ligands, among which about 75,000 (60\%) have a molecular weight of at least 350g/mol, the minimum weight requirement that a modern drug should bear. We have converted the entire 12 million ligands into PDBQT format in batch, and combined the 12 million individual structures and their 9 molecular properties and supplier information into one single file as huge as 50GB. We have recorded and encoded the offset of each ligand for fast random seeking and parallel docking.

\subsection*{Key features of idock}
We have revamped our docking engine idock to version 2.0, further improving docking speed and accuracy, inventing new functionalities, and fixing bugs. We highlight some key features. Please refer to the idock web site for a full list of enhancements and bugfixes.

idock implements a lightweight thread pool in order to reuse threads and maintain a high CPU utilization throughout the entire screening procedure. During program initialization, idock creates a thread pool of $N$ threads, where $N$ is defaulted to the number of CPU cores, or can be specified by users via a command line argument. When idle, the threads sleep. When tasks arrive, the threads compete for tasks. The thread that completes its current task will automatically fetch a pending one to execute until all are done. Synchronization is implemented to ensure the full completeness of tasks and availability of results. The task here is an abstract concept in programming sense and can be instantiated either as scoring function tasks, grid map tasks or Monte Carlo tasks. To be exact, the thread pool in fact parallelizes the precalculation of scoring function, the creation of grid maps, and the execution of Monte Carlo tasks.

idock implements our own lightweight thread-safe progress bar. For each ligand, it reports progress at every 10\% for the precalculation of scoring function, the creation of grid maps, and the execution of Monte Carlo tasks.

idock enables automatic recovery. While docking is in progress, in case the process gets killed accidentally and restarted some time later, idock not only resumes docking from the previous stopping point, skipping ligands that were already docked in a previous run, but also detects and reports possible file content errors, ensuring all the output ligands are well written.

idock supports reading and writing compressed ligand files with in gzip/bzip2 format, resulting in a file footprint as low as just one eighth of the raw size using gzip. This new functionality turns out to be extremely handy given an enormous amount of ligands to dock.

Both idock and AutoDock Vina support 16 common chemical elements, which are H (hydrogen), C (carbon), N (nitrogen), O (oxygen), F (fluorine), Mg (magnesium), P (phosphorus), S (sulfur), Cl (chlorine), Ca (calcium), Mn (manganese), Fe (iron), Zn (zinc), Se (selenium), Br (bromine), and I (iodine). idock supports 9 additional elements, which are Na (sodium), K (potassium), Co (cobalt), Ni (nickel), Cu (copper), Sr (strontium), Cd (cadmium), Hg (mercury), and As (arsenic). Hence idock supports as many as 25 chemical elements, covering the majority of atom types in the field of protein-ligand docking.

idock can be used as an external docking engine for our in-house \textit{de novo} ligand design and synthesis tool called igrow, which is implemented based on genetic algorithm and novel genetic operators to produce novel ligands by appending a molecular fragment to a ligand, by splitting a ligand into two, or by exchanging parts of two ligands. The produced population of ligands are then evaluated by idock and sorted according to their free energy predicted by idock. The whole system can also be hosted by istar.
