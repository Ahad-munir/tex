\section*{Abstract}
We are motivated by the desire to automate large-scale protein-ligand docking for drug discovery using our docking engine idock and thus have developed a web platform called istar. Without tedious software installation, users can submit jobs on the fly either by using our web site or by programming against our RESTful API. Our HTML5-powered istar web site supports 1) filtering ligands by desired molecular properties and previewing the number of ligands to dock, 2) monitoring job progress in real time, and 3) outputting free energy and ligand efficiency predicted by idock, binding affinity predicted by RF-Score, putative hydrogen bonds, and supplier information for easy purchasing, three useful features commonly lacked on other online docking platforms like DOCK Blaster or iScreen. We have collected 12,171,187 ligands from the clean subset of the ZINC database, and revamped our docking engine idock to version 2.1, further improving docking speed and accuracy, inventing new functionalities, and integrating RF-Score as alternative rescoring. To better evaluate and compare idock 2.1 with the state-of-the-art AutoDock Vina 1.1.2, we have carried out a redocking benchmark on the 2,897 and 2,455 protein-ligand complexes of the refined set of PDBbind v2012 and v2011 respectively and 343 protein-ligand complexes of CSAR NRC HiQ Set 24Sept2010, and a virtual screening benchmark on 12 diverse proteins and 3,000 ligands of different molecular weight. The results have shown that under various circumstances idock displayed comparable success rates but outperformed AutoDock Vina in terms of docking speed by at least 8.69 times and at most 37.51 times. % enrichment factor

\section*{Author Summary}

\section*{Introduction}
Protein-ligand docking predicts the preferred conformation and binding affinity of a small ligand when it is non-covalently bound to a specific binding site of a protein. Up to date, there are hundreds of docking programs \cite{493,922}. The AutoDock series is the most cited docking software in the research community. AutoDock has contributed to the discovery of several drugs, including the first clinically approved HIV integrase inhibitor \cite{1169}. Following its initial release, several parallel implementations were developed using either multithreading or computer cluster \cite{115,560,782}.

In 2009, AutoDock Vina \cite{595} was released. As the successor of AutoDock 4 \cite{596}, AutoDock Vina significantly improves the average accuracy of the binding mode predictions while running two orders of magnitude faster with multithreading \cite{595}. It was compared to AutoDock 4 on selecting active compounds against HIV protease, and was recommended for docking large molecules \cite{556}. Its functionality of semi-flexible protein docking by enabling flexibility of side-chain residues was evaluated on VEGFR-2 \cite{1084}.% To further facilitate the usage of AutoDock Vina, auxiliary tools were subsequently developed, including a PyMOL plugin for program settings and visualization \cite{609}, a bootable operating system for computer clusters \cite{773}, and a GUI for virtual screening on Windows \cite{1250}.

In 2011, inspired by AutoDock Vina, we developed idock 1.0 \cite{1153}, a multithreaded virtual screening tool for flexible ligand docking. idock introduces plenty of innovations, such as receptor and grid map caching for efficient large-scale virtual screening, revised numerical model for much faster energy approximation, capability of automatic detection and deactivation of inactive torsions for dimensionality reduction, utilization of our lightweight thread pool to parallelize grid map creation and reuse threads, utilization of the new C++11 programming features to avoid frequent memory reallocation, and accelerated parsers for both receptors and ligands. When benchmarked on docking 10,928 drug-like ligands against HIV reverse transcriptase, idock 1.0 achieved a speedup of 3.3 in terms of CPU time and a speedup of 7.5 in terms of elapsed time on average compared to AutoDock Vina.

Having released idock, we kept receiving docking requirements from our colleagues and collaborators. They are mostly biochemists and pharmacologists, outsourcing the docking research to us after discovering pharmaceutical protein targets for certain diseases of therapeutic interest. Consequently, we had to grab the protein structure, do format conversion, define search space, set up docking parameters, and keep running idock in batch for months. Tedious enough, all the above work was done manually, resulting in very low research productivity. In order to automate large-scale protein-ligand docking using our idock, we have therefore developed a web platform called istar.

There are other online protein-ligand docking platforms. DOCK Blaster \cite{557} investigates the feasibility of full automation of protein-ligand docking. It utilizes DOCK \cite{1222} as the docking engine and ZINC \cite{532,1178} as the ligand database. iScreen \cite{899} is a compacted web server for TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) docking and followed by customized \textit{de novo} drug design. It utilizes PLANTS \cite{610,607,779} as the docking engine and TCM@Taiwan \cite{528} as the ligand database. It also utilizes LEA3D \cite{1223} for \textit{de novo} ligand design. FORECASTER \cite{1012} is a web interface consisting of a set of tools for the virtual screening of small molecules binding to biomacromolecules (proteins, receptors, and nucleic acids). It utilizes the flexible-target docking program FITTED \cite{602} as docking engine. Nevertheless, the above platforms neither support fine-grained ligand selection based on molecular properties, nor display job progress in real time. They also lack straightforward output of compound suppliers, a hurdle preventing users from purchasing high-rank compounds for further wet-lab verification. Our istar platform has properly addressed these obstacles.

\section*{Components and Features}
Figure \ref{architecture} shows the architecture of istar. There are five major components: a web site, a web server, a database management system, several workstations, and a network file system. Under typical circumstances, a user browses our web site and submits a job. The web server first validates user input and then saves it into the database. Several workstations keep running daemons in the background, fetching jobs from the database and performing protein-ligand docking. Upon completion, they send a notification email to the user and write the result to the network file system, which is cached as static content by the web server. The user again browses our web site to download result or monitor job progress.

\subsection*{Web Site}
W3C (Worldwide Web Consortium) finalized the specification of HTML5 on 17 December 2012. This means developers have a stable target to write applications for. Compared with HTML4, HTML5 provides a way to write rich and real-time web applications. We have thus built our istar web site on top of HTML5.

On our istar web site, the first section displays summary of existing jobs and the second section allows new job submission. A job comprises compulsory fields and optional fields. Compulsory fields include a receptor in PDBQT format as used by idock and the AutoDock series, a search space defined by a cubic box, a brief description about the job, and an email to receive completion notification. Optional fields include nine ligand filtering conditions and ligand sorting criterion. The nine ligand filtering conditions are molecular weight, partition coefficient xlogP, apolar desolvation, polar desolvation, number of hydrogen bond donors, number of hydrogen bond acceptors, topological polar surface area tPSA, net charge, and number of rotatable bonds. The ligand sorting criterion can be either idock score, RF-Score, or their consensus score. RF-Score \cite{564} is a machine learning approach to predicting protein–ligand binding affinity. It has been integrated into istar as an alternative option to rescore predicted conformations. The consensus score is implemented as the arithmetic mean of idock score and RF-Score, so that it directly reflects the predicted potency in pKd or pKi unit.

We have collected 12,171,187 ligands at pH 7 in mol2 format from version 2012-04-06 of the All Clean subset the ZINC database \cite{532,1178} with explicit permission of its major developer and maintainer, and converted the entire 12 million ligands in batch into PDBQT format as used by idock and the AutoDock series.

The first key feature of istar is the support of ligand selection by desired molecular properties in a fine-grained manner and previewing the number of ligands to dock in real time (Figure \ref{slider}). Users can move the nine sliders to filter ligands in the form of closed intervals. Only the ligands satisfying all the nine filtering conditions will be docked. Because of the relationship of logical and, in order to nullify a specific filtering condition, one may expand its closed interval to cover the entire possible range. We have set up default values of the lower and upper bounds of the nine molecular properties for novices to get started easily.

The second key feature of istar is the support of monitoring job progress in real time. Thanks to the real-time features defined in HTML5, we have managed to compose a timer to automatically fetch and report the latest job progress every second without page refresh. Users can thus have a rough estimation in advance of how long the jobs will take and when the jobs will complete. This feature is particularly handy when the jobs are long running, which is usually the case of large-scale virtual screening.

\subsection*{Daemon}
After jobs are submitted and queued, it is the daemon that indeed performs protein-ligand docking. A daemon is a program running in the background and doing some kind of jobs. We have derived a daemon from the offline version of idock.

Our idock daemon performs 2-phase docking. In phase 1, idock performs coarse but fast virtual screening without writing any conformations, aiming to quickly shortlist a few thousand candidate compounds. In phase 2, idock performs fine but slow virtual screening, writing as many conformations as possible and aiming to refine the predicted free energy as well as the predicted conformation of candidate compounds.

Our idock daemon exploits fine-grained slice-level parallelism in phase 1 and coarse-grained job-level parallelism in phase 2. A job is split into 100 slices by evenly subdividing the 12 million ligands, and distributing the slices to idle workstations to achieve parallel docking.

The third key feature of istar is the output of free energy and ligand efficiency predicted by idock, binding affinity predicted by RF-Score, putative hydrogen bonds, and supplier information for easy purchasing.

\section*{Results}
%Compared idock to Vina
%Compared idock to DOCK

idock x86\_64 v2.1 and AutoDock Vina x86 v1.1.2 were evaluated and compared on desktop computers with Intel Core i5-2400 CPU @ 3.10GHz and 4GB DDR3 RAM under Mac OS X 10.7.4 Build 11E53. Arguments to both programs were left as default. By default, both programs output 9 predicted conformations per ligand. The benchmarks include comparison of their redocking performance in terms of predicted conformations and binding affinity correlation, and comparison of their virtual screening performance in terms of execution time.

\subsection*{Benchmark of Redocking}
Redocking refers to randomizing the crystal ligand conformation in a protein-ligand complex and trying to dock the randomized conformation back to its crystal conformation as close as possible. For the redocking benchmark, we used three datasets: the refined set of PDBbind v2012 \cite{529,530}, the refined set of PDBbind v2011 \cite{529,530}, and the two sets of CSAR NRC HiQ Set 24Sept2010 \cite{857,960}. They comprise 2,897, 2,455 and 343 protein-ligand complexes respectively, with experimentally determined binding affinity data (Kd or Ki). Note that the 2rio entry of PDBbind contains two Sr (strontium) metal ions, which are supported by idock but not by AutoDock Vina, so we manually removed them before invoking AutoDock Vina.

Figures \ref{Redocking1B8N,Redocking4TMN,Redocking1PKX,Redocking3HV8} visualizes the redocking results of four cases from the refined set of PDBbind v2011.  We used root mean square deviation, or RMSD for short, to measure the closeness between two conformations. The lower the RMSD is, the closer the two conformations are. Usually the RMSD value is calculated between a reference and a prediction. Very often the RMSD of 2.0Å is the positive control for correct bound structure prediction. In the case of PDB ID 1B8N, both programs managed to predict a conformation close enough to the crystal one. In the case of PDB ID 4TMN, both programs failed, probably due to the presence of a zinc ion in the binding site. In the case of PDB ID 1PKX, idock succeeded but AutoDock Vina failed. In the case of PDB ID 3HV8, AutoDock Vina succeeded but idock failed.

Table \ref{SuccessRate} shows the success rates of idock and AutoDock Vina under various conditions regarding the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) values between the crystal and docked conformations. Given a redocking case, RMSD1 refers to the RMSD value between the crystal conformation and the first docked conformation, i.e. the one with the highest predicted binding affinity, while RMSDm refers to the RMSD value between the crystal conformation and the closest docked conformation, i.e. the one with the minimum RMSD value. The condition RMSD1 = RMSDm tests for how many percent the docked conformation with the highest predicted binding affinity actually turns out to be the closest one among the 9 predicted conformations. It can be seen that the success rates of idock are comparable to, albeit slightly lower than, AutoDock Vina, and the success rates on CSAR NRC HiQ Set 24Sept2010 are consistently higher than PDBbind v2011 and v2012, probably because the scoring function performs well on carefully refined structures. Using a RMSD value of 2.0 \AA, a publicly accepted positive control for correct bound structure prediction, both programs managed to predict a conformation close enough to the crystal conformation as the first conformation for over half of the cases on both databases.

Figure \ref{FECorrelation} shows the binding affinity correlation of idock and AutoDock Vina. On the CSAR NRC HiQ Set 24Sept2010 dataset, the Pearson correlations between experimental binding affinities and binding affinities predicted by AutoDock Vina, between experimental binding affinities and binding affinities predicted by idock, and between binding affinities predicted by AutoDock Vina and idock are 0.5998758, 0.5774972, and 0.9824049, respectively. Although both programs did well in conformation prediction, they could not predict binding affinity too accurately, a very common obstacle in the entire computational chemistry community. As expected, the correlation between binding affinities predicted by both programs is very close to 1 because of their identical scoring function but slightly different approximation methods.

\subsection*{Benchmark of Virtual Screening}
We collected 12 diverse proteins from the PDB (Protein Data Bank) database \cite{540,537}, and 1000 ligands with a molecular weight of 200-300g/mol2, 1000 ligands with a molecular weight of 300-400g/mol2, and 1000 ligands with a molecular weight of 400-500g/mol2 from the clean subset of the ZINC database \cite{532,1178}. The 3000 ligands (Figure \ref{MWT-NRB}) were docked against the 12 proteins by AutoDock Vina and idock. Since AutoDock Vina can dock only one ligand in a run, a bash script containing 1000 lines was executed instead, with each line being an execution of Vina to dock one individual ligand. The GNU Time utility was used as a profiler.

Table \ref{ExecutionTime} compares the CPU time and elapsed time of both programs. The execution time varies a lot from protein to protein and from molecular weight set to molecular weight set. Basically idock outperforms AutoDock Vina by at least 8.69 times and at most 37.51 times.

\section*{Availability}
We emphasize full reproducibility. Both idock and istar are free and open source under Apache License 2.0. For idock, its C++ source code, precompiled executables for 32-bit and 64-bit Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and Solaris, 13 docking examples, and a doxygen file for generating API documentations are available at https://github.com/HongjianLi/idock. For istar, its C++ and JavaScript source code and RESTful API documentation is available at https://github.com/HongjianLi/istar. The istar web site is running at http://istar.cse.cuhk.edu.hk.

\section*{Discussion}

\subsection*{Comparison of Online istar and Offline idock}
Automation is the major reason of submitting jobs to istar instead of running idock locally on one's computer. On istar, there are over 12 million ready-to-dock ligands collected from ZINC \cite{532,1178}. These ligands come with supplier information for easy purchasing. 
, with supplier output plus RF-Score.
No set up required. No need to divide jobs into 100 slices. No need to write a script to filter ligands.
We have prepared two graphical tutorials for novices to get started easily. We have tested our istar web site successfully in Chrome 19+, Firefox 12+, IE 9+, Safari 5+ and Opera 12+. We aim to make istar into a large-scale online docking platform really pragmatic for the computational chemistry community and pharmaceutical companies.
We have prepared two graphical tutorials for users to correctly fill in the compulsory fields. Tutorial 1 illustrates how to prepare a receptor in PDBQT format with MGLTools \cite{596}. Tutorial 2 illustrates how to define a search space with MGLTools \cite{596}, Chimera \cite{1219} or PyMOL \cite{1221}. We deliberately do not introduce an automatic protein binding site detection tool but let the graphical tutorials guide this process with full customization.

\subsection*{Comparison of istar and DOCK Blaster}
DOCK Blaster \cite{557} is an expert system created to investigate the feasibility of full automation of large-scale protein-ligand docking.

Here we highlight the advantages of istar over DOCK Blaster. First and foremost, istar is free and open source under Apache License 2.0. Everyone is welcome to download a copy and deploy istar to his/her own servers. istar is designed as a general SaaS platform. It can host not only idock but also igrep and any other program. istar utilizes HTML5, CSS3, node.js, SPDY, NoSQL, GPU acceleration and so on, representing a state-of-the-art platform. istar supports filtering and previewing ligands to dock, as well as monitoring job progress in real time, two very useful features only available at istar. istar implements 2-phase docking and exploits fine-grained slice-level parallelism in phase 1.

Currently, we have deployed a machine with Intel Xeon W3520 @ 2.66 GHz and 8GB DDR3 SDRAM to run the web server, and two identical virtual machines with Intel Xeon E5620 @ 2.40 GHz and 8GB DDR3 SDRAM to run the idock daemon. We have mounted a 3TB hard disk into our network file system to store docking results. Due to limited budget at the moment, we cannot offer as much hardware resource as DOCK Blaster did (i.e. 700 CPU cores plus 20TB RAID-6 storage). As a compensation, we have released istar under a permissive open source license so that anyone who possesses sufficient hardware resource is welcome to deploy a copy of istar to his/her own infrastructure with no charge.

In the future we plan to port idock to GPU in order to further boost performance.

Give the structure of a target, both istar and DOCK Blaster will dock and score each molecule against the target and provide a ranked list which you may review and prioritize for purchase and testing.
