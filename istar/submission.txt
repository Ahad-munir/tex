Covering letter
We develop a web platform called istar to automate large-scale protein-ligand docking using our fast docking engine idock. It can provide the best docking poses for a particular protein target out of more than 12 million ligands. Users can easily customize the search space for the target and select which ligands to dock. Results directly provide where to buy compounds for wet-lab test. Our web platform is very pragmatic and much easier to use than DOCK Blaster. We believe many colleagues will be using it in the future.
