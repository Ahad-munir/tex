\section{Introduction}

As the X-ray crystallography technology evolves, more and more structures of biological macromolecules at atomic level have been revealed and deposited into the world's largest repository Protein Data Bank (PDB) \cite{539,537}. This rapid evolution catalyzes the development of various protein-ligand docking tools for structure-based drug discovery.

Protein-ligand docking is a method which predicts the preferred conformation of a small ligand when bound to a macro protein to form a stable complex. It also predicts the binding affinity in terms of free energy, which is basically the overall effect of various chemical forces involved. The lower the free energy, the higher the binding affinity. Very often, the target protein is a viral enzyme of interest, and the small organic ligands that are predicted to inhibit the viral enzyme are what we want to discover. Structure-based virtual screening is simply a massive version of docking. It docks a database of drug-like ligands to a target, ranks them according to their predicted binding affinity, and shortlists the best ones for further investigation.

\section{Motivation}



\section{Problem Definition}



\section{Method}

Figure \ref{fig:Flowchart} shows the overall flowchart of igrow. 

\begin{figure}

\caption{Flowchart of igrow.}
\label{fig:Flowchart}
\end{figure}

igrow remarkably revises the fundamental C++ implementation. igrow invents its own thread pool in order to reuse threads and maintain a high CPU utilization throughout the entire screening procedure. The thread pool parallelizes the execution of mutation and crossover operators. igrow estimates the capacity of every vector structure and intensively utilizes Rvalue reference, a new feature in the C++11 standard, to avoid frequent memory reallocation. igrow accelerates the assignment of atom types by making use of residue information for receptor and branch information for ligand, without explicitly detecting covalent bonds among atoms.

\subsection{Genetic Operators}



\section{Data}

In order to test igrow comprehensively, we collected 3 receptors from PDB \cite{96} and 8 unique initial ligands from PDB and ZINC \cite{55}. From these data, 18 test cases could be formed, as detailed below.

\subsection{Receptors}

We aim to select receptors that are of real-life importance. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3$\beta$) is a theoretically promising pharmacotherapeutic target for the treatment of several human diseases, including type-2 diabetes \cite{247} and Alzheimer's disease (AD) \cite{248}. Efforts into discovering new inhibitors of GSK3$\beta$ never stop \cite{246}. Therefore it was included into our test data.

HIV was also selected for its impact to human kind. According to the latest fact sheets of World Health Organization in 2010, 33.4 million people live with HIV/AIDS worldwide. HIV reverse transcriptase (HIV RT) and HIV protease (HIV PR), two viral proteins residing in the body of the virus, assist the virus in infecting human cells. Researchers have spent over 30 years in discovering new inhibitors of HIV RT and HIV PR \cite{221,222,223}. Therefore, they were also included into our test data.

Totally 3 receptors were collected from PDB \cite{96} for testing. They are glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3$\beta$) of PDB ID 1J1B \cite{245} of resolution 1.80 \AA, HIV reverse transcriptase (HIV RT) of PDB ID 2ZD1 \cite{180} of resolution 1.80 \AA, and HIV protease (HIV PR) of PDB ID 3KFN \cite{243} of resolution 1.77 \AA.

We manually extracted the 3 receptors out of their PDB complexes, and queried CSA (Catalytic Site Altas) \cite{206} and relevant publications \cite{245,246,180,221,222,223,243} for their possible binding sites, as shown in table \ref{tab:searchspace}.

\end{table*}

\subsection{Initial Ligands}

We aimed to select initial ligands that spread across wide ranges of free energies and molecular weights. The 3 ligands of PDB heterogeneous molecule IDs TRS, T27 and 4DX are respectively native ligands of GSK3$\beta$, HIV RT and HIV PR, hence they were included.

\section{Results}

We tested igrow v1.0 and compared it with AutoGrow 2.0.4, the most recent versions of both programs at the moment this paper was composed. The parameter settings for AutoGrow and igrow are listed in table \ref{tab:ParameterSettings}. The default values for AutoGrow were retained, i.e. 10, 20, 20, and 8 for the number of elitists, children, mutants, and generations, respectively.

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular*}
{\linewidth}
{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lrr}
\noalign{\smallskip}\toprule
Program & AutoGrow & igrow\\
\midrule
\noalign{\smallskip}
Number of elitists & 10 & 10\\
Number of children & 20 & 20\\
Number of mutants & 20 & 20\\
Number of generations & 8 & 24\\
Max number of atoms & 80 & 80\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular*}
\caption{Parameter settings for AutoGrow and igrow. Elitists refer to the best ligands of a generation that will survive directly into the next generation. Children refer to ligands generated by crossover. Mutants refer to ligands generated by mutation.}
\label{tab:ParameterSettings}
\end{table}

So far we have collected 3 receptors, each of which is associated with 6 initial ligands. Therefore there are 18 test cases in total. Since genetic algorithm is stochastic, we ran AutoGrow and igrow for 9 times for each test case under the parameter settings shown in \ref{tab:ParameterSettings}, simultaneously on 6 Linux machines with Ubuntu 10.04.1 x86\_64, Dual Intel Xeon Quad Core 2.4GHz, and 32GB RAM. Each AutoGrow execution and igrow execution cost approximately 3 hours and 2.4 hours respectively on average.

\subsection{Binding Pose}

In order to validate the correctness of ligands generated by igrow, we picked out the best ligand from each test case and visualized it in complex of its corresponding receptor. Here, the best ligand refers to the one that have the lowest free energy.
Figure \ref{fig:BestLigands} demonstrates one particular test case.

\subsection{Free Energy and Molecular Weight}

The goal of fragment-based growing strategy is not to generate one single best ligand, but a population of drug-like ligands to be shortlisted for further verifications by wet lab experiments. Therefore it is more meaningful to dig into the average performance of the best several ligands. Hence the predicted free energies and molecular weights of the best 5 ligands were plotted against generation number in figure \ref{fig:Best5}.

\subsection{Execution Time}

We also measured the execution times of AutoGrow and igrow. Since all the test cases were run for 9 times, their average execution times are shown in figure \ref{fig:ExecutionTime}.

\section{Discussions}

Through visualizing the generated ligands in complex of their respective receptors, we found that they are chemically valid, and we are thus of full confidence about the correctness of igrow. An example test case is demonstrated in figure \ref {fig:BestLigands}.
The best ligands generated by igrow have significantly lower molecular weights than those generated by AutoGrow, hence they are more likely to optimize into drugs.

Regarding the average free energies and molecular weights of the best 5 ligands generated by both programs, as shown in figure \ref{fig:Best5}, for most of the cases igrow displays a comparable free energy curve, while its molecular weight curve is remarkably lower than AutoGrow, and seldom exceeds 500, thanks to the guidance of Lipinski's rule of five and the `split' operator.

Regarding the execution time, as shown in figure \ref{fig:ExecutionTime}, igrow outperforms AutoGrow for 14 out of 18 test cases.
For the test case with GSK3$\beta$ as the receptor and ZINC20030231 as the initial ligand, igrow runs as much as 119\% faster than AutoGrow.
For the test case with HIV RT as the receptor and T27 as the initial ligand, although igrow requires 27\% more time, the generated ligands have lower free energies, as shown in figure \ref{fig:Best5}(g).
Averaging all the 18 test cases, in general igrow executes about 30\% faster than AutoGrow.
